Sunday, August 23, 2015  

This is my Shiny application for course assignment in which I used a simple dataset from Wikipedia (Source: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suvarnabhumi_Airport#Traffic_and_statistics> and introduced ladder plot to analyze performance data with simple yet effective visualization.

The ladder plot shows the relationship between the ranks of data in two or more columns. I have used `ggplot2` and `reshape2` libraries, to generate this plot.

The source code of the application is available at <https://github.com/ch3ckmat3/DDP-ShinyApp/> and a presentation detailing the app is published at <http://rpubs.com/ch3ckmat3/DDS-ShinyApp-Presentation>.

The application is live on Shiny servers at <https://ch3ckmat3.shinyapps.io/DDP-ShinyApp>
